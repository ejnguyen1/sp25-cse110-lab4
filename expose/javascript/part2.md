1. Line 12 prints `3`, the number stored by `i`. This is the size of the `prices` array.
2. Line 13 prints `150`, the most recent value stored in `discountedPrice`.
3. Line 14 prints `150`, the most recent value stored in `finalPrice`.
4. This function will return `[50, 100, 150]`, the `discounted` array. This array contains the values from the `prices` array, but discounted by the `discount` amount.
5. Line 12 causes an error. Because `i` is declared using the `let` keyword, it is block-scoped and therefore undefined outside of the `for` block.
6. Line 13 causes an error. Because `discountedPrice` is declared using the `let` keyword, it is block-scoped and therefore undefined outside of the `for` block.
7. Line 14 returns `150`, the most recent value stored in `finalPrice`.
8. This function will return `[50, 100, 150]`, the `discounted` array. This array contains the values from the `prices` array, but discounted by the `discount` amount.
9. Line 11 causes an error. Because `i` is declared using the `let` keyword, it is block-scoped and therefore undefined outside of the `for` block.
10. Line 12 prints `3`, the value stored in `length`. This is the length of the prices array.
11. This function will return `[50, 100, 150]`, the `discounted` array. This array contains the values from the `prices` array, but discounted by the `discount` amount.
